## A C++ filesystem-based movie review system.
This project was developed as a part of my school curriculum, scoring 10/10 as a final project.
Its a movie review system, akin to a console based version of IMDB.
It hosts multiple files, each holding Genres, Directors, Movies, Users, and Reviews. 
This project came as an opportunity to start implementing everything seen in my second semester; OOP, Dynamic Memory Assignation, Filesystem handling, and much more.
